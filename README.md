# My projects
CSCord made with C#, CSCord App with VB.NET and C# and more to come. I am also making a website for CSCord with HTML and CSS. I work on games aswell - I love to make games using C++ and you guessed it C#. Why do I use so much C#? I dont know. Also one of my favourites Typescript and I love to make discord bots using Javascript. I use Java to make Minecraft mods. PHP im still a beginner at and Lua im also begining - I would count them as "still learning" but I think 50% does count as almost knowing. Python im still learning and will be a beginner very soon. I missed MYSQL, I use it for my C# projects.
